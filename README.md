# celo-blocks

Indexes all Celo block data.

## Subgraphs

The official celo-blocks subgraph is available here: [Celo Blocks](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/ubeswap/celo-blocks)

As a stopgap, we've also launched the [Celo Blocks since the launch of Ubeswap](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/ubeswap/celo-blocks-since-ubeswap) graph. This exists because indexing for the full subgraph will take about a month-- instead, this subgraph is immediately useful for projects on Celo.
